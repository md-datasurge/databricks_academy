# Section 2: Development and Ingestion

Exam Weight: 30% — This is the heaviest section on the Associate exam. It covers building data pipelines to ingest and process data from common sources, working with Unity Catalog volumes, developing CDC pipelines with APPLY CHANGES, creating Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines, and reading and writing tables using Spark SQL and DataFrames.

# Databricks Connect

## Topic Overview

**Databricks Connect** lets you run Spark code from your local IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm, or IntelliJ) against a remote Databricks cluster. Instead of writing and testing everything inside a Databricks notebook, you can develop locally using your preferred tools, libraries, and debugging workflows while the actual computation happens on a cluster in your Databricks workspace.

This is particularly useful for teams that want to integrate Databricks into existing software engineering workflows. You get the full power of Spark without leaving your local development environment. Databricks Connect v2 (the current version) is built on top of Spark Connect and uses a thin client that sends queries to the cluster for execution. The local machine does not need Spark installed.

For the exam, the key thing to understand is when and why you would use Databricks Connect versus just using notebooks directly. It comes down to local IDE preference, CI/CD integration, and the ability to use local debugging tools.

## Key Concepts

- **What is Databricks Connect?**
    
    Databricks Connect is a client library that allows you to connect your local development environment to a Databricks cluster. You write PySpark or Scala code locally, and when you create a SparkSession using Databricks Connect, it routes all Spark operations to the remote cluster. Results are returned back to your local session. Think of it as a bridge between your laptop and the cloud compute.
    
- **Databricks Connect v2 vs v1**
    
    Version 2 is built on Spark Connect, a newer protocol introduced in Spark 3.4. Unlike v1, which required matching Spark versions between client and server and had many compatibility issues, v2 uses a thin client architecture. The client sends a logical plan to the server, and the server handles execution. This means you do not need a local Spark installation. v2 also supports Unity Catalog and serverless compute.
    
- **Supported use cases**
    
    Databricks Connect is great for: running and debugging PySpark or Scala Spark code from a local IDE, running interactive data exploration from Jupyter notebooks on your laptop, integrating Spark workloads into CI/CD pipelines, and developing applications that use Spark as a backend processing engine. It is not designed for production job scheduling (use Lakeflow Jobs for that) or for running streaming workloads in v2.
    
- **Authentication and configuration**
    
    To connect, you need three things: the workspace URL, a cluster ID (or serverless compute), and authentication credentials (typically a personal access token or OAuth). You configure these either in code when creating the SparkSession, through environment variables, or via a Databricks configuration profile (~/.databrickscfg). The DatabricksSession.builder is the primary entry point in v2.
    
- **Limitations**
    
    Databricks Connect v2 does not support all Spark APIs. Some low level RDD operations, certain streaming APIs, and direct SparkContext access are not available. It also requires an active cluster (or serverless compute) to be running, which means there is a startup cost. UDFs work, but they must be serializable and compatible with the cluster's Python/Scala version.

## Code Examples

### Setting up a Databricks Connect session (Python)

```python
from databricks.connect import DatabricksSession

# Option 1: Configure directly
spark = DatabricksSession.builder.remote(
    host="https://<workspace-url>",
    token="<your-token>",
    cluster_id="<cluster-id>"
).getOrCreate()

# Option 2: Use a Databricks configuration profile
spark = DatabricksSession.builder.profile("DEFAULT").getOrCreate()

# Option 3: Use environment variables (DATABRICKS_HOST, DATABRICKS_TOKEN, etc.)
spark = DatabricksSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Now use spark just like you would in a notebook
df = spark.read.table("my_catalog.my_schema.my_table")
df.show()
```

### Reading and writing data through Databricks Connect

```python
# Read from a Unity Catalog table
df = spark.read.table("catalog.schema.table_name")

# Run transformations locally defined, executed on the cluster
result = df.filter(df.status == "active").groupBy("region").count()

# Collect results back to local machine
local_df = result.toPandas()
print(local_df)

# Write back to a table
result.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("catalog.schema.aggregated_table")
```

## Common Exam Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Local IDE development**

A data engineer wants to use VS Code with breakpoints and step through debugging for their PySpark code, but needs the code to execute on a Databricks cluster. The correct approach is to use Databricks Connect v2, which creates a remote SparkSession. The engineer writes and debugs code locally, but all Spark operations are sent to the cluster. This is the primary use case Databricks Connect was designed for.

**Scenario 2: CI/CD pipeline integration**

A team wants to run integration tests as part of their CI/CD pipeline. The tests need to read from and write to real Delta tables. Using Databricks Connect, the test suite running in a CI environment (like GitHub Actions) can establish a Spark session against a Databricks cluster, execute the tests, and validate results. This avoids the need for a local Spark installation in the CI runner.

**Scenario 3: Choosing the right tool**

A question asks which tool allows a data engineer to develop Spark applications from their local machine without installing Spark. The answer is Databricks Connect. Key distinction: Databricks Connect is for interactive development and testing. For scheduled production jobs, you would use Lakeflow Jobs. For quick ad hoc analysis, notebooks might be more appropriate.

## Key Takeaways

- Databricks Connect lets you run Spark code from a local IDE against a remote Databricks cluster without installing Spark locally.
- Version 2 uses Spark Connect (thin client architecture) and supports Unity Catalog and serverless compute.
- Primary use cases: local development with IDE debugging, CI/CD integration, and interactive exploration from Jupyter.
- You need a workspace URL, cluster ID (or serverless), and authentication credentials to connect.
- Not a replacement for notebooks or Lakeflow Jobs. Use Databricks Connect for development, not production scheduling.

## Gotchas and Tips

<aside>
⚠️ **DatabricksSession, not SparkSession.** In Databricks Connect v2, you use `DatabricksSession.builder` to create your session, not the regular `SparkSession.builder`. The DatabricksSession extends SparkSession, so after creation, you can use it the same way.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️ **Cluster must be running.** Databricks Connect requires an active cluster or serverless endpoint. If the cluster is terminated, your session will fail. There is no local execution fallback.

</aside>

<aside>
⚠️ **Not all APIs are supported.** Low level RDD operations, SparkContext access, and some streaming APIs are not available in v2. If an exam question mentions RDD manipulation via Databricks Connect, that is likely a distractor.
